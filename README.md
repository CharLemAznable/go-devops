    USER = user owning the process
    PID = process ID of the process
    %CPU = It is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running.
    %MEM = ratio of the processâ€™s resident set size to the physical memory on the machine
    VSZ = virtual memory usage of entire process (in KiB)
    RSS = resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (in KiB)
    TTY = controlling tty (terminal)
    STAT = multi-character process state
    START = starting time or date of the process
    TIME = cumulative CPU time
    COMMAND = command with all its arguments



Process state codes:

    R running or runnable (on run queue)
    D uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
    S interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
    Z defunct/zombie, terminated but not reaped by its parent
    T stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced

Some extra modifiers:

    < high-priority (not nice to other users)
    N low-priority (nice to other users)
    L has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
    s is a session leader
    l is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
    + is in the foreground process group
